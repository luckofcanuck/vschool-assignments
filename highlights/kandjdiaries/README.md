###KandJ Diaries

=========================

This project was an exercise in conversion. KandJ Diaries is an archived out-of-use website that I rewrote from scratch in order to showcase my abilities in converting PSDs, wireframes, or, in this case, another webpage. I can clean things up, make them functional, and turn whatever vision a client has into a reality.
