###Dish App

=========================

This is a full stack app that allows users to enter information about their favorite food dishes. The bulk of the work done in this app is on the back end. There are large models set up to allow as much information about a dish as possible to be searched in separate ways. I have two different search functions on the site. One quick search that uses regex and to determine if a user entered string is anywhere within a stored dish object, and another advanced search option that uses an over-complicated if-then algorithm to determine which req queries will be needed in the get request. 

This app is mostly a demonstration of developing models, using a non-relational database, and various uses of HTTP/CRUD requests.
