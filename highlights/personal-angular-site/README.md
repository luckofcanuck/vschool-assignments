###Discover by Authors

====================================

This is the first AngularJS app that I developed. A user can search an external API for an authorâ€™s name, and a list of other works by that author will return. I wrote some of my own filters to sort and format the responses of these requests, as the API is not entirely well organized and has many duplicates and capitalization errors. I also provided links to purchase the returned works on Amazon.com, given the ISBN that is in the response data.
