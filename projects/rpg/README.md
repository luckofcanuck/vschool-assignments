In this project I created a terminal-based role-playing game. It is done 100% in JavaScript and uses readline sync to interact with the user. It asks for the user's name, and stores it. It asks which class the user wishes to be, and which weapon the user wishes to use, and the user's health and damage are modified accordingly. The user is then given the option to walk, check his or her inventory, or check how much health he or she currently has. When walking the user has around a 1/3 chance of an interaction. There is a 1/10 chance this interaction will be an item found, and added to their inventory. If this is the case the item will be 1/3 things, two of which increase either health or damage. If the interaction is not an item, it will be one of three enemies. The user may then run or fight. Running has a 1/2 chance of working, and results in the enemy striking first blow should the user not get away. Fighting goes in turns, and assigns the user and enemy random damage power within a certain range given their preset attributes. If the user dies, the game is over. If the user wins, he or she is awarded an item, and the game continues. The user wins when they have accrued seven items in their inventory.
