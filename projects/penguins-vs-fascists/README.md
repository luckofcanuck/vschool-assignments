I created a program that sets up two parties, the Fascists and the Penguins. After a random "coin toss" to determine who goes first, the parties take turns nuking each other for random amounts of damage to the other party's population (or the chance to miss altogether). I use objects, constructor functions, and callback functions to run this simulation until either population is depleted and the end-message is relayed.
