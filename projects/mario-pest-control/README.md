### DOM and Styling 
========================

I created and styled a responsive and functional webpage. It changes orientation given the screen size. It has three different "Mario" enemies listed. Each enemy is worth a set amount of coins. The user can enter how many of each enemy Mario has caught. When this is done, and the "=" buttons are pressed, they are given a result of how many coins Mario earned for his hard work. If they do this for all three enemies, and click the total button at the bottom of the page, they will see what Mario's final haul for the day was.
