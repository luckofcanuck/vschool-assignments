### V School Assignments
=================================

This is the main README file for all of my assignments from V School. Each of the child directories in this directory represents a warmup (generally a quick logic test in JavaScript to get the brain cracking at the start of the day), assignment (tasks completed after learning new topics to solidify the information), a project (longer-term assignments that range from complex terminal RPGs to solo and group-developed full-stack web apps), or a highlighted project (something developed during the bootcamp that I feel best showcases the skills I learned in the program).
